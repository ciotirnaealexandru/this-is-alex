## A linear algebra background

Throughout my first year of college, specifically in my **Linear Algebra** (in romanian, **Algebră liniară, geometrie analitică si ecuații diferențiale**), we studied the concept of **Linear Tranformations** and their real world applications.

\( A \in \mathcal{M}_{m,n}(\mathbb{R}) \)
